  What it Does 💻

1. Wakes Up on Command: It sits and listens quietly until it hears the trigger word, "Jarvis," and then it's ready for your instruction.

2. Web Browsing: Just tell it to "open Google" or "open YouTube," and it launches the sites in your default browser.

3. App Launching: It uses the handy AppOpener library to launch applications like WhatsApp directly on your machine.

4. Local Music Playback: Got a collection of Music or Songs? Define them in the musiclib.py file, and you can ask it to "play song [song title]" and it'll handle the rest!

5. Talks Back: It uses Text-to-Speech (TTS) to confirm your commands.
